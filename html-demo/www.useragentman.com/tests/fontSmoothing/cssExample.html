        <div class="fontSmoothingMessage initiallyHidden">
            <p>You browser <strong>is</strong> rendering this page
            with font smoothing. Because of that, we will attempt
            to serve up the Droid Sans font to render this page,
            because we think it looks cool. If you are using a
            browser (such as Google Chrome) that cannot render
            downloaded True Type fonts by default, then the page
            will be rendered using Arial instead.</p>

        <div class="noFontSmoothingMessage initiallyHidden">
            Your browser <strong>is not</strong> rendering this
            page with font smoothing. It is for that reason we have
            decided to use the plain old Arial font to render this
            page, because it is hinted for use for displays that
            don't employ a font-smoothing technology.
